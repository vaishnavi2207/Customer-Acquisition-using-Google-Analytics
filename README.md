# Problem Statement
Google Analytics has data available at vast combinations of metrics and dimensions. We were working for a client who was entering a new market and they were using their website to sell their products.

What information will benefit a new business tremendously?
When will their website have the highest traction
We cannot emphasize enough on the benefits that come with knowing this one number. Depending on the kind of business, it can help reduce uncertainties in different parts and answer pressing questions like “How much inventory should I keep?” or “How do I allocate my resources” — salesforce in our case. While in our case knowing the number of visitors on the website tomorrow may not help too much (since the website is already up and running and designed to handle moderate traffic), knowing the number of people who will “enroll” for the services in the future can help us forecast our demand (and many other things) which can answer a lot of important questions.

Which customers have a higher lift of conversion
Once we know the forecast for the demand in the future, understanding what drives that demand can be highly valuable information, especially for a nascent company. GA tracks a myriad of attributes about the users — the channel they came through, their age, their gender, the device they are using, etc. Leveraging these attributes to set strategies proves to be highly beneficial.
